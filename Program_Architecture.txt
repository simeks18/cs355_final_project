Program will use a ncurses GUI to create a file explorer that has the ability to encrypt and decrypt files using the following algorithms.
1. XOR encryption
2. ??
3. ?? 

Program Design - Efficacy
1. An embedded key is generated and stored in a hidden file. This key is generated upon first run and is based on unique machine data. Possibly user ID?
2. Generate keys for different encryption methods based on this embedded key. Store them in a hidden file. 

Program Design - File Handling Methodology 
Encryption Process
1. A simple 16-bit Twos complement checksum is generated of the original file contents.
2. The file is then encrypted and prefixed with a 5 byte header. 
    Header Contents (Little endian): Emebedded Key (MSB) | Emebedded Key (LSB) | Twos Complement Checksum (MSB) | Twos Complement Checksum (LSB) | Pointer to encryption method used

Decryption Process 
1. A file is opened and the first two bytes are read to see if it matches our embedded key.
2. If so, we know the file has been encrypted. Read the next two bytes and store the checksum.
3. Load the pointer to the encryption method used to call the coresponding decryption routine (Array of function pointers)
4. Run checksum routine to ensure decryption was performed successfully.
